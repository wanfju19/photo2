html 5 to resize,rotate photo. This is not a big library you can use directly as a file uploader. But you can know how to resize , rotate a photo with HTML5. It is more flexible if you can learn how to do this and copy snippet of code to your application.

The reason I develop this is I found many perfect file upload library is too big and I can not apply those library in my application.
